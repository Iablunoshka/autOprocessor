This repository contains an automated script written in Python that enables you to upload, process, and publish videos on YouTube. The script is designed to automate the process of finding, uploading, processing, and publishing video content to your YouTube channel.

Features:

Video Download from 9gag: The script automatically finds and downloads video content from the popular source, 9gag.
Format Conversion: Videos downloaded in webm format are automatically converted to mp4 format for compatibility with most platforms.
Duration Sorting: Videos are automatically sorted into short (less than 1 minute) and long (more than 1 minute) categories, placed in their respective folders.
Video Processing: Videos with a duration of less than 1 minute are processed for optimal vertical display.
YouTube Upload: After processing, videos are automatically uploaded to your YouTube channel.
Requirements:

Selenium: Used for automatic video download from websites.
Requests: Used for downloading videos from URLs.
DateTime: Used for generating unique file names based on the current date and time.
